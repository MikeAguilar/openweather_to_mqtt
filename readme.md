# OpenWeather API to MQTT
This is a Python application running in a Docker container that uses OpenWeather API to get the current weather information and publishes it to an MQTT Broker. 

### Important Considerations
- The **OpenWeather API** requires a key, however, they do have a free tier, which is what I use for testing.
- The connection to the MQTT broker is via HTTP, consider the security implications when publishing over the public Internet.

## Features
- Collect current weather info from OpenWeather API for a specified city.
- Publish MQTT messages for Temperature, Humidity and Pressure to a specified MQTT broker.

## Important files
- `./docker-compose.yml`

- `./dockerfile`

- `./requirements.txt`

- `./app/main.py`

- `./app/config.py` _(this file is listed  in the `.gitignore` file, so you need to rename the sample file provided)_

- `./app/example-config.py` _(rename this file to `config.py` once you have modified it with your own info)_ 

## Settings for `config.py`
### General Variables
- `device_name` = "my_first_node"
    </br> The device name needs to be alphanumeric and '_' or '-' only as it becomes part of the publishing topic.
- `freq` = 120 
    </br> This number indicates how often (in seconds) the app will request OpenWeather API data and publish it.

### OpenWeather Information
- `api_key` = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    </br> You can get a free API key from the OpenWeather API website.
- `city` = "Seattle"
    </br> This is the city that will be requested from the API. This name also becomes part of the publishing topic. The application will remove blank spaces from the City value to ensure the topic is valid.
- `units` = "imperial" 
    </br> These are the units that will be used in the response. They can be `standard`, `metric`, or `imperial`.

### MQTT Broker Information
- `mqtt_addr` = "your.mqtt_broker.address"
    </br> This is the IP or Hostname/FQDN for your MQTT Broker.
- `mqtt_port` = 1883
    </br> This is the Port for your MQTT Broker.
- `mqtt_user` = "your-mqtt-user"
    </br> This is the User for your MQTT Broker.
- `mqtt_pass` = "your-mqtt-user-password"
    </br> This is the Password for your MQTT Broker.

### MQTT Publishing Details
- `topic_temp` = "home/openweather-tracker/`device_name`/`city`/temperature"
- `topic_hum`  = "home/openweather-tracker/`device_name`/`city`/humidity"
- `topic_pres` = "home/openweather-tracker/`device_name`/`city`/pressure"
</br> Note that the topics will be populated by **default** as presented above. Only change them if absolutely necessary.

## Instructions to run it
In this example, Docker Compose will build the Docker image using the included `dockerfile` and application.

- Download the project from Github to a machine with Docker and Docker Compose installed.

- From the CLI, change to the directory where you downloaded the repository `openweather_to_mqtt` to.

- Modify the `example-config.py` file with your own information and rename it to `config.py`

- **Start** the application with `docker-compose`
    ```
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
- **Stop** the application with `docker-compose`
    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```
